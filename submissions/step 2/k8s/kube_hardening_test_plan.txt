How you will test the changes?
Usually projects has environment integration, staging and production.
Integration, staging are environments non-production. The change has to be tested in environment non-production cluster (test cluster).
Also, it can bring up a test cluster using tools like kubetest (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/kubetest/README.md)
More tools for test cluster can be checked in: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/22/kubernetes-end-to-end-testing-for-everyone/

How you will ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?

The change should be tested in a non-production cluster.
