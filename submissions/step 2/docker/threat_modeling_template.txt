Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on
the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from
the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

Document each of the 3 findings you want to harden to the existing:

[FAIL] 2.14 Ensure containers are restricted from acquiring new privileges (Automated)
[FAIL] 3.7 Ensure that registry certificate file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)
[FAIL] 3.8 Ensure that registry certificate file permissions are set to 444 or more restrictive (Automated)

Finds are related to:
1. Spoofing On Docker Client - Client traffic from the Docker client to the Docker daemon or registry could be spoofed or intercepted by a malicious party and replayed
2. Tampering and Repudiation On Docker Client - An attacker gets control of the Docker client tampering of the Dockerfile thatâ€™s used to build the image.
   Once the client is compromised, the attacker may use it to make changes that are not legitimate.
5. Repudiation on Docker Registry - Malicious images may be committed without authorization by an attacker.
